When I'm hanging out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
I trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing act your age

I don't wanna waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity
And back down

Because you don't
Know us at all, we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small?

Three important rules for breaking up:
Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to
Prolonging the situation only makes it worse
Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly
Don't make a big production
Don't make up an elaborate story
This will help you avoid a big tear-jerking scene
If you wanna date other people say so
Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected
Even if you've gone together for only a short time and haven't been too serious
There's still a feeling of rejection when someone says she prefers the company of others to your exclusive company
But if you're honest and direct and avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you break the news
The boy will respect you for your frankness
And honestly, he'll appreciate the kind of straight forward manner in which you told him your decision

Descending, I'm spinning

只要坚持就不会错 用力的say my name
错过也是一种心得 You got no one to blame
永远这么酷 永远永远 这么酷
像个冒险家一样不断探着山顶的路
要做就做自己的idol 像陈年的茅台酒
品尝的资格只有用心酿的人才配拥有
不想被牵着鼻子走 遇到困难低着头
在人生的十字路口 会有伯乐们招着手

It's easy to love when the world doesn't hate you
When you're tryna sing out, but nobody hears a word
It's safer to swim when the tide's not against you

(Hey, you've been here before)
I know that you've been here before
(Never letting go)
Giving up is letting go
(Never fight alone)
But you don't have to fight alone

I'll shed a tear for you
Open your eyes, I'm by your side
I'm never leaving you
Darkness to light
Stay through the night
I'm walking in your shoes
So you know that it's the truth
When nobody's here for you
Let me make it clear
That I'll shed a, I'll shed a tear
(Shed a tear, shed a tear, shed a tear)
(Shed a tear, shed a tear)

And I'll feel your pain when I know you're in trouble

I'mma say that I prefer the no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed

My grades like my jeans, in time I had to pull em up
That's the thing about life we soon forget to live it up
There's a part of us that dreams, I just hope we keep in touch, and so

I tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet,
Party on down to the Xscape beat.
Just kick it.
Just kick it, just kick it.

Every man wants a woman,
That can cook him up a good meal.
A woman he can treat like his homie,
And take her out on the Ave. and just chill.

Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi

But they ran a fine line between me and you

Parents trying to find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light

So if you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to Day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse
See I ...

All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk

Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead
Held up so high on such a breakable thread

You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be

You were everything, everything that I wanted
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
All of the memories so close to me just fade away
All this time you were pretending
So much for my happy ending

It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
'Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say, ""I told you so""
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo

Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso, y nos decimos adiós

She's down in it
She tried her best but now she can't win
It's hard to see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

way down
She sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night
And I know I could break her concentration

Dazed and kinda lonely

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things

You're the magician's assistant in their dream

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song
And I got a lump in my throat
'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf
