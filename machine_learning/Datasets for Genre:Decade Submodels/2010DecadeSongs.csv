I love when our lips are fighting
And do it all over again, love so blinding

Wanna be all on you as long as you're here
Inside your arms, this is paradise
My future's in your eyes

Don't wanna go go go go go nowhere
My eyes roll back when you're pulling my hair
As long long long as you don't disappear
Don't be afraid, take me there

You wanna come ride my wave like the ocean
You wanna kiss on my skin like the sun
Show me, como
You wanna love me right now til forever
Just don't talk baby you gotta show
Show me, como

De 0 a 100
Aquí no soy pálido
Se pasarla bien
Quiero recorrer tu piel
Poner el mundo a tus pies
Yo sé que tu corazón lo siente también

Your necklace hanging from my neck,
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (We decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?

Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, god damn
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law no Horus eye

Keep me from going crazy

Straight up ahead you'll find a sign
That says you can't get by with a lie
But if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path
And made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say
Then you wouldn't know a single thing about how I feel about you
And all those really dumb things people feel
I'll take the bumpy road, it'll probably break my legs
As long as I don't show you what's ruining my head
Funny thing about you is you read me pretty well
But you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well
Annoying you with smoke signals, asking you for help
'Cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell

Me and Mr. Heart, we say the cutest things about you
How you seem unreal and we'd prolly die so quick without you
Suffocated from the radiated air around us
Full of happiness we don't have

Une bouffée d'oxygène dans la kush

Le genre d'endroit où il est difficile de ne pas croiser au minimum une ex-maîtresse
À l'heure où les mignonnes secouent leurs hanches, et où les chasseurs préparent tous leurs plans
Elle m'est apparue seule au fond d'la boîte, comme un crayon d'couleur blanc
Le temps s'est arrêté pendant quelques secondes, j'étais figé me demandant: ""Est-elle de ce monde?""
Trop belle pour un décor aussi laid, le charisme et l'élégance d'une actrice de ciné (Ah, tu forces)
Si ce moment était une chanson, j'aurais kiffé mettre un pull up
L'impression de regarder un film en noir et blanc où elle était la seule à être en couleur
J'ai bu mon verre sec, j'ai rafraîchi mon haleine, puis j'suis parti lui parler
Elle s'est retournée d'un air dédaigneux, et ses yeux semblent dire qu'elle espérait mieux (cheh)

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?

Got me running, running, ooh

Había decidido
Caminar en soledad
Sin pena ni pasión

Todo cambió
Me fui acercando a vos
Con suma precaución
Midiendo cada paso
Retorcido en mi interior
Librándome de miedos y de deudas del ayer
Para intentar de nuevo
Volver a querer
Me entregué y no me arrepiento
Nuca estuve así de contento
Y hoy me paso el día cantando
Sin pensar hasta cuando
Amor

While we're alive
Can we relax, isn't that what are mates for

You were there for me
And I was there for you
How will I let you go
You will always be
The one that I regret
How will I let you go

I better hold on to this feeling before it's gone
Whatever happened we both grew as time moved on

Looking at blue skies
Dreaming of old times
Brighter days will come
Looking at blue skies, with you in my mind
I'm the only one,
Brighter days will come

Whenever it's smoke, we ain't running

Cut through a slip in the cracks

Impossible to just ignore

And I've got all these other things to do

Everyone I've ever loved is easily amused

Just like the shirts that's so lovely
So ask Marco Polo and I never go solo

I hope you find romance... try your luck take a chance
Til I enter like the Milton Plaza I'm the center
Of it all, the fuckin' prince of the ball
Standing six feet tall, that's a long way to fall
But not worry, cause my vision ain't blurried
The +I+ is hotter than the spice and curry
So don't stress the father or you might feel the fury

So check the situation, a raw deal is what we facin'
What's the flavour of the rules they mandate
The climbin' gets hotter as the city gets smarter (?)
A million one catch they tryin' to earn top dollar
Half that mill, they straight out to kill
I'm cultivated and destined to act real ill
Black let up in the things of five burroughs of pain
Only reason why the east and the west it ain't the same
I'm twenty-something years of age and life surely ain't about hand-outs
So I lace my plan out, hard work is levicated to an encore survival

You feeling like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You having sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets thinking you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead so you just follow the sheep
Making sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like ""Yeah, he got it from me""
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word ""fun"", what do you envision
Probably drinking and smoking out with your crew
And chilling with clueless women you trying to bang, bumping New Edition
Is that all you think life really is
Well if so, then you're a fucking idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain, GIMME IT!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from bagging these hoes and packing a bowl
Well let me guess- No
You're only in school because your parents make you go
And all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bros
Yo, society's got you living for a whack cause
You're a fucking adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw, you literally do nothing at all
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is ""I got money and it's stacked to the roof""

The time is now on everything
Took my heart away from money
Aint interested in fame
But I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It's something that's in your veins
And I put that on my name

Uh, the only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times were harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking at the niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Aint get accepted, well rejected and now they regret it
Aint get my message, was a signal when I was texting
The bitch I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I'll be the Quarter back
Me and Folarin MMG gon bring that Warner back

Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, but much harder to live it
They gon love me for my Ambition

1970...
Nací un día de junio del año '77
Planeta Mercurio y el año de la serpiente
Si no patente tatuado y en mi frente
Que en el vientre de mi madre
marcaba el paso siguiente
Me hace llorar sin anestesia en la camilla
Mi padre solo dijo es Ana María
Si sería el primer llanto que me probaría
Quemando las heridas y dándome la batería
Solía ser entonces como un libro abierto
Pero leí la letra pequeña del texto
Como un arquitecto construyendo cada efecto
Correcto, incorrecto, se aprende todo al respecto
Saber que algunas personas quieren el daño
Subir peldaño toma tiempo, toma año
Con mi peluche mirando lo cotidiano
Dibujos transformaban el invierno en gran verano
Papá me regaló bajo mi insistencia
Un juego, trataba de culparte y recivencia.
Pero en el cartu hicieron la competencia
Y fue cuando sentí mi primera impotencia

To the way that you loved me

Have to go and do it without me baby

But everyday seems like I'm waiting for the seasons to change
Everyday feels like I'm moving even further away

Sins are expensive and Jesus paid the cost

These church signs, they light up these roads that I roam
They're leading me closer, they're calling me home
The further I get, the further I go
This interstate gospel is saving my soul

Hello Hello, goodbye
You must have called my name a thousand times by now
You try, you try, you try,
and even though your heart pretends it's over
I know it's hard to mend, but you can't forget this love

I admit I was confused in my days growing up
My grades like my jeans, in time I had to pull em up
That's the thing about life we soon forget to live it up
There's a part of us that dreams, I just hope we keep in touch, and so
Baby please don't vex, did you read those texts?
You want me home but I'm pretty sure we need those checks
Let me be whoever I'm gonna be
Hiding behind personas it simply won't work for me
I am Poe! And women you know that you are my lady

Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc

Que no les hace falta un hombre para vivir feliz
Just say whoa-oh

Y no es tan facil que te dejes seducir

Tu te mantienes y no tienes que dar detalles
De lo que tu quieres hacer en la calle
Si te la gozas y la vida la vacilas
Y en la disco se te tiran encima

12 o'clock and my body hits the streets up
And the strip looking like about to heat up
Llego la mami que a todos desespera
Te deja boca abierta cuando esta negra llega

Oh no, they tryin' keep up but they just too slow
They think that I'm the one but they just don't know

Our cave's collapsing
I don't wanna be me anymore

""You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down.""
Forty miles out of East Illinois of my old man's
heart attack

I believed you were crazy
You believed you loved me

And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells

Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody

Y me dicen lo que estás pensando

Ey, no me digas que te sientes mal
Y que este sitio no te está gustando
Sólo faltan unas copas más

Dice que le gusta el honey
Baladas un montón
Pero cuando está en la disco y le ponen reggaetón
Ella se vuelve loca, ella se vuelve loca, ey

Quien la viera en su casa
Resalta, cómo no
Pero cuando está en la disco y le ponen reggaetón
Ella se vuelve loca, ella se vuelve loca

Le encanta que la vean
Cuando ella perrea

Only wanna be mine for the good times now, but

To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

On the way to the bar

With my fingers in your hair

Once she gets a little touch

Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish

Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushin' daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
He keep telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Cuando tú me miras, se me sube el corazón

Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)

Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

(Hate!) You keep askin' me where I'm from
(Hate!) About the borders and, ""Did I run?""
(Hate!) Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
There's a light (hate!) and dark army, which side you choose?
Oh (hate!) If not now then when?
(Hate!) And if not me then who?
(Hate!) Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
(Hate!) I tried to tell y'all about this dude

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Hate supplements are found right in their couches
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna' get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no hoe

Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance

Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

You just might be doing whatever it
Takes to drown out the noise

Got my head in a mess, girl I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
