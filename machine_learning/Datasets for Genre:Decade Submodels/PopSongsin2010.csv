To find the strength to steal it back?

That suffocates the way that I think
If somehow all becomes far from misfortuned destiny

To pass each day, confined to feeling so empty

Echo that begs to be followed

Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us niggas
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring

Si tu traînes dans un bar à tains-p'
Ma-mafiosa, ma-mafiosa
Assim você me mata

Et voilà que j'parle en portugais

I would put you far away from the decaying roots that bore you

It would somehow grow inside you

I'd tackle all your obstacles and kill them with precision
And better the intentions of every single person

Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight

Then I die for you
Calling on those that call me son
Great-grandson and grandson
Great uncles, aunts, and relatives

To judge what I have done

En el taxi, la conocí caminando por un backstreet
Estaba sexy, pero tan sexy
Que por poquito arrollamos un tipo y chocamos el taxi
Era el chofer
Él que dijo: ""!Oye, mira esa mujer!""
Está dura, dura, qué dura
Pero ya tú sabes que ella quiere efectivo dinero, Visa
Qué chula, lula, con culo de mula
Y no le tengas duda, ella le saca todo el jugo a la uva
Que hace vino

I breathe your air when I land in another city
I'll be that one that's got you printed on my bones

Hello Hello, goodbye
You must have called my name a thousand times by now
You try, you try, you try,
and even though your heart pretends it's over
I know it's hard to mend, but you can't forget this love

I admit I was confused in my days growing up
My grades like my jeans, in time I had to pull em up
That's the thing about life we soon forget to live it up
There's a part of us that dreams, I just hope we keep in touch, and so
Baby please don't vex, did you read those texts?
You want me home but I'm pretty sure we need those checks
Let me be whoever I'm gonna be
Hiding behind personas it simply won't work for me
I am Poe! And women you know that you are my lady

Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time
I would've broke my heart in two
Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't wanna feel another touch
Don't wanna start another fire
Don't wanna know another kiss
No other name falling off my lips
Don't wanna give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again, oh, oh, oh, oh

Down underneath the waves
I wish I could remember
How we were yesterday
But now I can't pretend that
We'll ever be the same

Something's changed, I'm not quite sure
Talking less but hiding more
And I don't know what you're thinking
Tryna figure out

Don't know how
You're a stranger to me now

But if you could fight, if you could choose
If you could say all the things you wanted to
If you couldn't lie
If you would only move like you had something to lose
If you could cry, if you couldn't sleep it off
If you could feel everything you've ever caused
If you couldn't lie

Descemer

Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras, se me sube el corazón
(Me palpita lento el corazón)
Y en un silencio, tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Tu cuerpo y el mío llenando el vacío
Subiendo y bajando (subiendo y bajando)
Bailando, bailando, bailando, bailando
Ese fuego por dentro me está enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

Con tu física y tu química, también tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila, y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (ya no puedo más)
Ya no puedo más (ya no puedo más)

Con esta melodía, tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía mi cabeza está vacía
Y ya no puedo más (ya no puedo más)
Ya no puedo más (ya no puedo más)

Yo quiero estar contigo

Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast, and then we talk slow

And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
Oh, I'm in love with your body
Oh-i-oh-i-oh-i-oh-i
